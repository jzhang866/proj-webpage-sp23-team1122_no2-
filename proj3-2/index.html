		In assignment 3-2, we have finished Part 1 and Part 4, implementing Mirror and Glass Materials rendering and Depth of Field rendering.

<div class="container">
	<h2 id="task1">Part 1</h2>
	<p>
		1.1
	</p>
	<div class="row justify-content-md-center text-center">
		<div class="col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/t1_0.png" ><p>max_ray_depth = 0</p></div>
		<div class="col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/t1_1.png" ><p>max_ray_depth = 1</p></div>
		<div class="col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/t1_2.png" ><p>max_ray_depth = 2</p></div>
		<div class="col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/t1_3.png" ><p>max_ray_depth = 3</p></div>
		<div class="col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/t1_4.png" ><p>max_ray_depth = 4</p></div>
		<div class="col-md-6"><img class="img-fluid" src="img/t1_5.png" ><p>max_ray_depth = 5</p></div>
	</div>
	<p>
		1.2 When max_ray_depth is set to 0, the light source is rendered. When it is set to 1, we can see the walls, the floor and the reflection on two spheres.
		When it is set to 2, we can see the ceiling, more natural shadows, the reflection of the environment on both spheres while that on the right one is
		much shallower. When it is set to 3, We can then see the ceiling in the left mirror sphere and the refraction phenomenon in the right glass sphere.
		When it is set to 4, the reflection of the glass sphere in the mirror sphere is correct, also we can see a light spot on the right wall. When
		max_ray_depth is set to 5, everything looks almost the same as the last one, except the whole scene looks a little brighter.
	</p>
	<p>
		1.3 In zero-bounce situation, we can only see the light source because it's the only light that goes directly into cameras without any bounces.
		When it is one-bounce rendered, it equals to direct illumination. Some light falling on the spheres, walls and the floor from the light source would bounce to
		the camera. When we take the second bounce into consideration, some light after one bounce would then go to the both spheres and then bouncing back
		to the image plane, resulting to a second-bounce and the reflection on the two spheres. We would also find the shadow is much more natural and we can see the ceiling now, because
		some light falling on the wall would bounce back to the shadow area and the ceiling and then bounce to the camera. When max_ray_depth is set to 3, some light after one bounce on the floor would
		bounce to the sphere and then bounce to the camera, leading to the reflection of the ceiling on the left sphere. What's more, after two refractions(bounces), some light falls in the shadow of
		the right sphere and after one more bounce, we can see them from the image. Besides, some light rays after the first bounce would bounce in the right sphere's direction, and after two refraction,
		which are also two bounces, go to the image plane, enabling us to see the refraction phenomenon in the right glass sphere. The main feature after four bounces is the light spot on the right wall.
		This is because some emitted light would first bounce on the left wall and experience two fractions, arriving at the right wall. Then after one more bounce, these spots bounce to the image plane, leaving that
		spot on the rendered image. The fifth bounce does not introduce any clear differences. However, there are still many minor changes like the whole image is a little brighter, since after one more bounce more light arrives at the image plane and contributes to the image.

	<h2 id="task2">Part 4</h2>
	<p>
		4.1 Pinhole model is an ideal model where everything is in focus, so the projection on the image plane would be a perfect inverse of the scene. However, in reality we would have lens instead of a hole in the
		camera. This would introduce some difference. For instance, not every thing would be in focus, instead, only objects at some certain distance would be clear in the image, while others won't. It results from the fact
		that the lens can only perfectly project the light from some specific distance on the image plane, while others will not be in focus.

	<h2 id="task6">Collaboration</h2>
	<p>
		In assignment 3-2, Zhiwei and Jinghua finished reports and coding equally. We both think it was a great collaboration and had an excellent outcome. Although we were responsible for different parts, both of us have learned all the knowledge in this assignment because we went through all
		the code, including that was responsible by the other one.
